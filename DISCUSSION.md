# Performance Improvements

Ran out of time but there is a work in progress branch.

https://github.com/jaimeburnap/solace/tree/performance

 - Adds indexes to table for terms that can be searched
 - Adds pagination to the search results
 - Updates seeder to insert more rows

This branch does not work as it currently sits. I just committed it to show the progress.
